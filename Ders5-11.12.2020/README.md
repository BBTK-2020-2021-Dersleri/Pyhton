
### EXAMPLE1
```diff
- Write a function called numberCompare. This function takes in two parameters (both numbers).
- If the first parameter is greater than the second, this function returns
- → "First is Greater".
- If the second parameter is greater than the first, this function returns
- →"Second is Greater"
- Else the function returns
- →"Numbers are Equal".
```
**Example output**

* numberCompare(1,1) # "Numbers are equal"

* numberCompare(1,0) # "First is greater"

* numberCompare(2,4) # "Second is greater"

### EXAMPLE2

```diff
+ Write a program to print all strong numbers between a given interval in
+ programming. How to print strong numbers in a given range using functions .
+ Write a function to find strong numbers between 1 to n.
```
**What is Strong number?**

Strong number is a special number whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the
original number.

* For example: 145 is strong number. Since, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

**Example**

**Input**

* Input lower limit: 1
* Input upper limit: 1000

**Output**

Strong numbers between 1 to 100: 1, 2, 145

### EXAMPLE3

**Is a Number Prime?**
```diff
!A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and
!itself. Write a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime,
!returning True if it is, and False otherwise. Write a main program that reads an
!integer from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. 
```
### EXAMPLE4
```diff
+Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit
+the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February
+29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are
+referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
```
• Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.

• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.

• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.

• All other years are not leap years.

Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

### EXAMPLE5
```diff
- Write a function that determines how many days there are in a particular
- month. Your function will take two parameters: The month as an integer
- between 1 and 12, and the year as a four digit integer. Ensure that your function
- reports the correct number of days in February for leap years. Include a main
- program that reads a month and year from the user and displays the number of days in that month.
```
### EXAMPLE6

```diff
!Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique
!elements of the first list.
```
**Sample Output:**

* List=[1,2,3,3,4,4,4,2]

After updating

* List=[1,2,3,4]

### EXAMPLE7

```diff
+ Delete element from the list. Dont use del method!!
```

### EXAMPLE8
```diff
- Write a program that accepts an integer parameter and computes and returns
- the sum of all the digits of that number. For example, sum_of_digits(38015)
- returns 3+8+1+0+5 or 17. For negative numbers, return the same value as if the
- number were positive. For example, sum_of_digits(-72) returns 7+2 or 9.
```
### EXAMPLE9
```diff
!Dikdörtgen çevre ve alan hesabı, kare çevre ve alan hesabı aynı zamanda
!silindirin hacim ve alan hesabını yapan fonksiyonları yazınız.
!Bunun için bir de menü yapınız. Menü içerisinde kullanıcıya seçenek sunun.
!Kullanıcı 1 girerse kare ile ilgili işlemleri, dikdörtgen girerse dikdörtgen ile ilgili
!işlemleri, 3 girerse silindir ile ilgili işlemleri yaptırınız.
!Kullanıcı q girene kadar menüden çıkış işlemi gerçekleştirmeyiniz.

Write a program that reads a position from the user. Use an if statement to
determine if the column begins with a black square or a white square. Then use
modular arithmetic to report the color of the square in that row. For example,

```diff
+ if the user enters a1 then your program should report that the square is black.
+ If the user enters d5 then your program should report that the square is white.
``` 
Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered. It does not
need to perform any error checking.

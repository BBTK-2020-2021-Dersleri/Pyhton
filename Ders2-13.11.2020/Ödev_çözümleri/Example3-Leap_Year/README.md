Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the
Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is
included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to
as leap years.

```diff
The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
- • Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
- • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
- • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
- • All other years are not leap years.
```

Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message
indicating whether or not it is a leap year.
